## Features ‚ú®

* **Task Management:** Add, edit, and delete daily tasks. Assign specific deadlines (date & time) or leave them as day-long goals.
* **Aggressive Reminders:** Get notifications 30 minutes before, 5 minutes before, and exactly at the deadline for timed tasks. (Note: Relies on PWA `setTimeout` via Service Worker, reliability may vary based on device/OS battery optimization).
* **Daily Productivity Score:** Automatically calculates the percentage of tasks completed each day.
* **"Unfiltered Truth" Feedback:** Displays motivational (or brutally honest!) messages based on the daily score.
* **"Yesterday First" Report:** When opening the app for the first time each day, it displays the previous day's final score and lists any incomplete tasks.
* **History Tracking:** The "Track" page shows a chronological list of past daily scores. Click on a past score to view the report details for that day.
* **PWA Installable:** Can be added to your phone's home screen for an app-like experience.
* **Dark Mode Toggle:** Simple theme switching.
* **Data Persistence:** Uses browser `localStorage` to save all tasks and history locally on your device.

## Motivation ü§î

This app was built to solve the personal problem of frequently forgetting tasks and deadlines, especially when focused on other work. Standard to-do lists and notifications were too easily ignored. This app aims to provide more persistent reminders and direct, data-driven feedback on daily productivity.
